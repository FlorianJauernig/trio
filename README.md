# TRIO
This repository contains the code for the paper "Trust in Sociotechnical Systems: The Case of Aluminum Packaging Process" and a tutorial for Microsoft Azure Digital Twins (ADT). It matches the used code and files 1:1, except for two aspects:
* The unique URL of the Digital Twin was replaced by a clearly noticeable placeholder in the "azure_digital_twin" script and notebook.
* The trained model was not comitted due to file size constraints.

The code was created using Python 3 and the Python packages listed in "requirements.txt".
